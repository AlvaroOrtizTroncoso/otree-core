    Persistent Lab URLs

    <p>
    Here are some example persistent URLs you can use in the lab. They will stay constant for new sessions, even if the database is recreated.
    </p>

    <p>
    {% for url in open_session_example_urls %}
        <a href="{{ url }}">{{ url }}</a>
        <br/>
    {% endfor %}
    </p>

    <p>
    You should take these links, copy them for as many participants are in your session,
    and modify the <code>{{ participant_label }}</code> parameter of each link.
    The above is just an example.
    You can use whatever naming scheme you would like to use, e.g. <code>{{ participant_label }}=PC-1</code>, <code>{{ participant_label }}=PC-2</code>, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    When a user visits one of these links, they are routed the session, that is currently set open.
    </p>
    {% if open_session %}
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        Currently all participants are going to be routed to the session
        <a href="{% url 'session_description' open_session.pk %}" target="_blank">{{ open_session.code }}</a>.
    </div>
    {% else %}
    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
        You have no open sessions.
        Before launching your experiment open one of the sessions
        via <a href="{% url 'admin_home' %}" target="_blank">admin interface</a>.
    </div>
    {% endif %}

    <p>
    Note the parameter <code>{{ access_code_for_open_session }}</code>. This is defined in your <code>settings.py</code>.
    You can change it as frequently as you'd like, to prevent unauthorized server access.
